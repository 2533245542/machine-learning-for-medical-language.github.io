## Primate Facial Recognition

**Abstract:** This project aims to develop a computer vision system capable of recognizing and distinguishing different primates based on facial features. It involves designing a deep learning model trained on a dataset of primate images, potentially gathered from zoos, wildlife documentaries, and field researchers. The goal is not only to distinguish between different species, but also to recognize individuals within a species. Such technology could be immensely beneficial in primatology research, aiding in individual tracking, behavioral studies, and conservation efforts.
