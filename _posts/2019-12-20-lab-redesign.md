# Redesigning our lab practices

What makes a good academic lab? What sorts of practices, traditions, events, and expectations
can we build to make this lab more ideal? This was the goal of our **lab redesign**
this fall. We changed a lot, and learned a lot, and hope our lessons can be of some use to others.

Our approach pulled from the field of human-centered design. Very creative and smart
folks in design have come up with ways of being creative around specific problems,
and have also thought a lot about what makes a great team and working environment.
If you're interested, I recommend checking out the courses put out by [IDEO](https://www.ideou.com/).
I can vouch that these courses are entirely worth it. (I personally took the course entitled 'Cultivating Creative Collaboration').

We met several times in meetings dedicated to the redesign. In the first,
we describing the current state of the lab. What do we do already?
We also brainstormed the attributes that we think describe a successful and desirable
lab environment. In the second meeting, we brainstormed new possible practices. That's it.
We did not select anything as things we might actually do. In the third meeting,
we narrowed down these proposals and grouped these proposals into categories.

What we ended up with was a list of things that seemed like great lab practices.
So as to not start everything all at once, we settled on implementing just one new
thing each week. It's a democratic process: at our lab meeting each Wednesday,
we all look at the list and vote on the new thing to implement. We've settled on
some awesome things! (Scroll to the bottom if you just want to see what our new
  lab practices are.)

Here's what the process looked like at each stage.

## 1. What makes a good lab environment?

We already did some nice things as a lab. The main problem was that these practices
were established long before anyone (besides Konrad) arrived, and they had kind
of lost their steam. We spent some time just outlining what those things were.
Most things we ended up keeping (free coffee!) but it was helpful to recommit.

We then outlined some of our goals in an open discussion. You can see some of our priorities
on the whiteboard above.

An academic lab is a workplace and team, not so different than a start-up but with the additional
pressures of learning, grant-writing, and publishing. There's a wonderful concept of "psychological safety"
that any manager (or PI) should aim for. When an environment promotes psychological
safety, it promotes 1) a learning mindset (in which it is OK to make mistakes),
2) a curious mindset (in which people are curious of everyone's thoughts. PIs, looking at you!)
3) a vulnerable mindset (in which people feel welcomed to express their shortcomings).


## 2. How might we design our lab environment? Diverging & Brainstorming

The design process (or IDEO's version of it) separates the process of coming up with
new ideas into two phases. **1) Diverging** and **2) Converging**. By first brainstorming
ideas without selecting among them, you encourage more creativity and diversity
among ideas. It avoids the failure mode of just running with the first good idea.

In this first stage, we spent 5 minutes in silence writing ideas onto post-its.
(I highly recommend the post-it approach as opposed to hand-raising or open discussion.
Our best ideas came out from that silence. It's efficient and gets ideas equally from everyone).
IDEO folks will tell you that post-its also allow the idea's originator to detach
themself from their own ideas.

After a few rounds of post-its and idea presentations, we had over 100 ideas of
awesome-sounding lab practices.

## 3. Converging

We wanted to ensure that the process was democratic throughout. (This is all about
creating a lab environment that everyone feels they own, after all.)
Since voting on 100 things is a lot, we took another trick from IDEO's book
and did *parallel voting*. Everyone had ~5 votes in each of several categories,
and in a mad dash we voted on everything and then dropped the 1/2 of ideas with
the least votes.

## 4. A continued process of weekly voting.

Instead of deciding right away what the full list of new practices will be, we
decided to take it slow and choose a new thing one at a time. This is now what
we've been doing every week of the fall. In the first 10 minutes of lab meetings
(or rather, lab teachings), we nominate a few possibilites from the list, then
do a show of hands. Then – ta da! – we have a new lab practice.

## 5. Every new practice has a czar

When we decide on a new practice, we also nominate a person to be in charge of
bringing it into being and ensuring it continues to happen. We found this to be
enormously helpful. The czars rotate once a semester so people don't get burnt out.

## 5. Overall takeaways



## 6. Our current list of practices

Our practices generally fall into the categories of *physical environment, scheduling,
orientation, social, research communication, mentorship, documentation, and resources.*

0. **Lab teachings**: A member of the lab leads a ~1 hour 'teaching' on a subject
of their interest. It cannot be updates on their current research. This is a longstanding
Kording lab practice. http://kordinglab.com/2018/08/29/upcoming-lab-teaching.html
0. **1-on-1's**: Every member of the lab is required to sit down with every other
member of the lab and discuss their work for an hour. Refreshes once a semester.
0. **Physical environment**: We now have 1) little magnetic pandas that are used
to indicate if you would like not to be bothered, 2) yoga mats, 3) a hammock,
4) a hangboard, 5) plants, 6) a tea kettle, and 7) espresso machine and free coffee.
0. **Tea talks**: The tea czar makes tea, and someone gives a 10 minute talk about anything.
Usually someone talks about an idea they're working on in their research. This happens weekly.
0. **Monday morning donuts**: Our lab is not an early-morning lab. Some of us need
a push out of bed. For that reason we have donuts in the lab served at 9:00am every Monday.
0. **A potluck lunch**: Once a semester, we have a potluck.
0. **DJ Friday**: We just play music in the lab on Friday afternoons!
We have a shared lab YouTube playlist, and anyone can add to it.
0. **Failure Friday**: Academia is full of times of disappointment, big and small.
To bring these events into the open, we have a Failure Friday every now and then
in which people are encouraged to discussed things that did not go as hoped, what
they learned, and (if asked for) for advice going forward.
0. **'Extreme' (pair) programming**: All about learning to code! Everyone is matched
with someone else, and the two of them code together. One codes, the other watches, and
then they switch.
0. **Lab calendar**: A simple Google Calendar that everyone can edit. For these
lab practices but also for seminars and so on.
0. **Web redesign efforts**: These are more one-off things. If we vote on a specific
web improvement, then we appoint a czar and they are in charge of coordinating the lab
to get this done. Often these are resources we want, like how-to's.

That's the list! There are still things to be voted on, too – it's an ongoing process.
An orientation buddy system and more social events are likely upcoming additions.
