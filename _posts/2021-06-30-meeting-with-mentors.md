# How to have productive meetings with busy mentors
*by Ari Benjamin with help from Ilenna Jones and Nidhi Seethapathi*

Setting meetings with research advisors and mentors seems straightforward but really isn't. It can take a few years before these meetings really start working for you. 
To jumpstart this process, here are 10 tips we've come up with for how to set meetings. We tried to design them so that they'd work in general, which means they won't be
perfect for any one mentor or any one mentee.

#### 1. Set meetings in advance.
It’s important to have regular meetings, but it can be scary to schedule a meeting when you don’t know what you’ll be talking about yet. Don’t worry about that. There will always be something important you can talk about. Setting meetings early gets you on their busy schedule and encourages you to think about how to communicate your mind. It lets you get a peek inside your mentor's brain and lets them get a peek inside yours. As the meeting approaches you will be able to decide what is most important.
#### 2. Set aside time the day before to prepare.
Why take time away from research to prepare materials about research? It seems counterproductive. But, unfailingly, research is limited not by slow production but by clarity and vision. Preparing will help! Points 3-5 are about what you might actually prepare.
#### 3. Plan to lead the agenda.
You’ve thought a lot more about your projects than your mentor. The natural power dynamic between a mentor and mentee, though, means that more often than not the mentor ends up steering the conversation. It is crucial that they hear what you’re thinking enough to understand your thought process. Until they do, they might not know what you need to hear. Solely mentor-led conversations may be interesting but are not grounded in your personal progression. Gentle cues like a meeting agenda, slides, or other prepared materials can go a long way in getting the conversation you need.
#### 4. Start with the basics. 
Context-switching takes time and mental resources. Your mentor has, unfortunately, too many contexts to keep up with. Start the meeting with some basic information that your mentor already knows. Especially busy mentors may even have forgotten some basics entirely, and some introductory framing can give much-appreciated cover. 
#### 5. Think beyond project updates.
The work of a meeting could be anything. Some possibilities include asking specific questions, asking about the high-level context of a project, learning their bird-eye view of the field, brainstorming together, writing an abstract live together, reading text you’ve written aloud, re-aligning project directions, and discussing how a project fits into your research portfolio.
#### 6. Be gracious.
Many meetings revolve around discussing or responding to material. Perhaps you are meeting to discuss some reviews on a submitted manuscript. Your mentor should have read the reviews, but maybe didn’t fully. Spend time summarizing or highlighting those reviews before discussing next steps. (This also makes sure you’re on the same page.) Or perhaps you wrote a new version of a manuscript. Depending on your mentor, it might be helpful to discuss an abstracted structure of the manuscript (main messages, rhetorical approach, figures) rather than the manuscript per se. How much of this work you make easy for your mentor will depend on their mentoring style.
#### 7. Refuse to be confused.
It may be hard to signal confusion when you feel you “should” know something. Try to avoid this: progression comes from exploring your points of confusion. It’s also hard for an expert to know what points will be confusing in advance, so your open confusion can be very helpful. If you feel the conversation is sidetracked, offer to keep the conversation moving forward if you can just look it up later. Also – and this is important  – if you feel condescension or any sort of negative response to your open confusion, this is your mentor’s fault and not yours. They are failing to create an environment of [psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) in which mistakes are okay.
#### 8. Shared milestones calendar.
Have a calendar you share with your mentor on your research and career milestone goals: conference submissions, paper submissions, candidacy date, fellowship submission, etc. Have strategic meetings once or twice a semester to chart out plans to achieve the milestones and evaluate progress.
#### 9. Look out for number one.
If you ever feel stuck (for weeks, say) or like your project is not going the way you want it to, or if you feel there is something fundamentally wrong in the way you are approaching things, put your interests first and feel free to let your mentor know how you are feeling. Your career goals and your mental health are very important, to both you and your mentor, but you are the one who has to look out for that. Your mentor has a million things on their mind and may not have the bandwidth to worry/notice.
#### 10. Plan a followup during this meeting.
Like setting meetings in advance in general, this seems hard at first. It’s normal. If there’s nothing to follow up on, just set the meeting a few weeks away (1-10 or more, depending on your relationship and whether this is your primary advisor).
